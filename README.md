### Overview
This API enables CRUD operations for customers and their orders. Authentication is implemented via Google OAuth2 using `social-auth-app-django`.
`Swagger UI` is used to generate interactive API documentation that lets users try out API calls directly in the browser

### Features
1. CRUD operations for customers and orders
2. OAuth2-based authentication using OpenID Connect
3. SMS alerts via Africa's Talking SMS gateway
4. Tests with CI/CD integration

### Getting started
#### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.9
2. Django
3. Django REST Framework
4. OpenID Connect provider
5. Africaâ€™s Talking account (for SMS)
5. Postman or Curl (optional for testing)

#### Installation
1. Clone Repository: `https://github.com/Frost-Codes/SI-Backend-Technical-Challenge.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Apply the migrations `python manage.py migrate`
5. Run the server `python manage.py runserver`

### Authentication
